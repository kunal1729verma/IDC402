# IDC402: Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos

This repository serves the purpose of hosting the code and the report for my term paper on **Measuring the correlation dimension of strange attractors** for the course IDC402: Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos at IISER Mohali. This term paper is essentially an extension of a project problem present in Steven Strogatz's book on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, namely Problem (Project) 11.5.1.
